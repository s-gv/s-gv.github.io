            <description><![CDATA[
<p>In the old days of 8086, 16-bit programs accessed physical memory directly.
This would be valid code and would work:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
    int *p = (int *)0x02ad;
    return *p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>x86 processors still boot into 16-bit real mode where this is fine, but the
OS switches the processor into protected mode which enables virtual memory.
Once virtual memory is enabled, each process has its own virtual memory
that the OS has to map (to physical memory, files on the hard drive, device registers, etc.).
If the program tries to access unmapped memory, a segfault happens.</p>
<p>When Linux starts a process and loads the executable to memory, the layout of
the virtual address space looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>---------------
|             |
|    stack    |
|             |
--------------- 0x7ffc725866b4
|             |
|             |
|             |
|   unmapped  |
|    space    |
|             |
|             |
|             |
--------------- 0x000001773000
|             |
| data (bss)  |
|             |
---------------
|             |
|    data     |
|             |
---------------
|             |
|    text     |
|             |
---------------
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>text</code> segment contains the binary code of the executable, the <code>data</code> segment
has initialized static variables, the <code>bss</code> segment has uninitialized static variables
(zeroed out before main() function is called), and the <code>stack</code> segment contains the stack
(There's also space for the environment variables, and the OS kernel space is also mapped
for performance reasons, but I've skipped these in the diagram.) The adresses of 
the these segments is randomized when the executable is loaded as a security measure (ASLR).</p>
<p>When <code>malloc()</code> is called, it tries to allocate memory from previously freed memory that
is still mapped to the process. But if there is insufficient free memory, <code>malloc()</code> must
make one of these system calls to request the OS to map additional memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>brk</code> / <code>sbrk</code> system calls enlarge the data segment. In the diagram above, calling <code>sbrk(8)</code>
would move the end of the data segment from <code>0x1773000</code> to <code>0x1773008</code>. If the process wants
to free the memory and return it to the OS, the data segment can be shrunk with the same syscalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>mmap</code> syscall can map pages anywhere in the virtual address space (the equivalent syscall
in Windows is <code>VirtualAlloc</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>malloc</code> implementation in glibc uses <code>sbrk</code> when it needs small amounts of memory (~32K) and <code>mmap</code>
when it needs large amounts of memory. The reason <code>mmap</code> is preferred for large objects is to prevent
losing too much memory to fragmentation in the data segment; if a small object is allocated with <code>sbrk</code>
after a large object and then, if the large object is freed, that memory cannot be freed
until the small object is freed as well.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Host Your Own Private Git Repos</title>
            <link>http://www.sagargv.com/blog/host-your-own-private-git-repos/</link>

            <description><![CDATA[
<p>Hosting git repos on your own server is actually quite easy.
Login to the server, create a new directory, and initialize a bare repo:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir foo.git
cd foo.git
git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Now, from the client, clone this repo with:</p>
<pre><code>git clone username@example.com:path/to/foo.git
</code></pre>

<p>Having a dedicated user for git repos on the server makes it easier share access to the repo.
Create a new user <code>git</code> with a login shell restricted to git commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo adduser --shell $(which git-shell) git
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a repo in the home directory of the <code>git</code> user:</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/git
sudo -u git mkdir bar.git
cd bar.git
sudo -u git git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>As before, clone the new repo from the client using:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@example.com:bar
</code></pre>

<h2>Backup the repos</h2>
<p>This is my script to take daily backups of all the git repos on the server to Amazon S3.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

GITDIR=/home/git
TMPDIR=/tmp/gitbackup

renice -n 15 $$

trap &quot;rm -f /tmp/gitbackup/*.git.tar.gz&quot; EXIT

mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}
cd ${TMPDIR}

for proj in ${GITDIR}/*.git; do
    base=$(basename $proj)
    tar -C $GITDIR -zcf ${base}.tar.gz $base
done

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyyyy
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

aws s3 cp ${TMPDIR}/*.git.tar.gz s3://mygitbucket/
</code></pre>

<p>If the repos are large, it might be worthwhile checking whether
the hash of the gzipped repo has changed before uploading.
It's also good idea to use <code>envdir</code> to manage the access keys rather
than putting them in the backup script.</p>
<h2>Web front-end using cgit and nginx</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to view source code and commits on a
web browser. <code>cgit</code> is an awesome light-weight webapp for this.
Unlike heavy apps like GitLab, <code>cgit</code> needs no database, which
reduces the administrative burden.</p>
<p>Install cgit, nginx, fcgiwrap, and apache-tools (to create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file).</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install cgit nginx fcgiwrap apache2-utils
</code></pre>

<p>Specify the location of the git repos and static assets in the 
<code>cgit</code> config at <code>/etc/cgitrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>css=/cgit-static/cgit.css
logo=/cgit-static/cgit.png
favicon=/cgit-static/favicon.ico

#source-filter=/usr/lib/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.py

scan-path=/home/git/
</code></pre>

<p>To get syntax highlighting, install <code>python-pygments</code> and uncomment the source-filter option.</p>
<p>If you'd like to password protect access to <code>www.example.com/git/</code>, create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my <code>nginx</code> conf file to serve <code>cgit</code> from <code>www.example.com/git/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name www.example.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    server_name www.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location /cgit-static/ {
        alias /usr/share/cgit/;
    }

    location /cgit/ {
        auth_basic &quot;Restricted&quot;;
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/cgit)(.*)$;
        fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO        $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/lib/cgit/cgit.cgi;
        fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING     $args;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_HOST        $server_name;
        fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
    }

    location / {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to restrict repo access to only whitelisted IPs.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Pagination in SQL</title>
            <link>http://www.sagargv.com/blog/sql-pagination/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>http://www.sagargv.com/blog/sql-pagination/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
<p>Here are two ways to paginate the results of a SQL query that work across all
the popular SQL database systems.</p>
<h2>Truncate the results</h2>
<p>Silly though it sounds, this might be a reasonable strategy. Suppose you want
to show 15 results per page. Then, show up to 20 pages, and stop there. This works
well when it's unlikely that anyone would want to see past the first few pages.
Incidentally, Google does something like this for web search results.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY creation_date LIMIT 15 OFFSET 45;
</code></pre>

<p>This query is not efficient for large offsets because rows up to the offset have
to be read and discarded. But that's OK since the offset is limited to a few
hundred rows at most. It's a net win if only the first few pages are read most
of the time.</p>
<h2>Keep track of the first and last result in a page</h2>
<p>This is based on the idea that random access is not really needed and that it's often
necessary to only access the next page and the previous page from any given page.
When you're on the fourth page, accessing a random page, say page 3124, might
be inefficient. But, accessing the third and fifth pages are efficient if the
right indexes have been setup. This is accomplished by keeping track of the first
and last values of the column on which the results are ordered.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE creation_date &gt; ? ORDER BY creation_date LIMIT 15;
</code></pre>

<p>When the next page is requested, the query is executed with the <code>creation_date</code>
of the last user in the current page. For the previous page, the <code>creation_date</code>
of the first user in the current page is used:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE creation_date &lt; ? ORDER BY creation_date DESC LIMIT 15;
</code></pre>

<p>If the column by which the results are sorted is not unique, add additional columns or
the primary key to <code>ORDER BY</code> and keep track of the first and last values of those columns as well.</p>
<p>Another example of using this method for pagination is in the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ScrollingCursor">SQLite wiki</a>.</p>]]></description>
