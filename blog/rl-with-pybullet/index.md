# Reinforcement Learning with PyBullet in Colab
*Jul 6, 2021*

Some tutorials on reinforment inforcement learning in PyBullet using soft actor-critic with a simple custom robot that can move in only one plane:

- [2D Reacher - Reach a point on the table](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ww-oKm-WTsH4PyBHGm5VMUCsD88bv9os?usp=sharing)
- [2D Pusher - Push an object on the table](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N8JrLelcV1jtJq61KeE5Gc7otIH0tzuI?usp=sharing)
- [2D Reacher from Pixels - Reach the marked point on the table](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bumvdASL-GDqGirUngJjoZCtiw0yl2Kp?usp=sharing)
- [2D Pusher with Inverse Kinematics - Push an object on the table](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N8JrLelcV1jtJq61KeE5Gc7otIH0tzuI?usp=sharing)

This can serve as a template to get started with a custom robot and might help in debugging some learning algorithms that directly control the actuators of a robot.
