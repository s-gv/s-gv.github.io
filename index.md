I'm a PhD student advised by [Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur](http://chips.ece.iisc.ernet.in/index.php/Bharadwaj_Amrutur) at the
Indian Institute Of Science.  My current research is on natural scene text recognition.
In a previous life, I worked on low-power circuits.

## Pet Projects
- [Cooker Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sagargv.cookercounter) is an Android app that uses the microphone to keep track of pressure cooker whistles.
- [Cookoo](http://www.sagargv.com/proj/cookoo) is a device that keeps track of pressure cooker whistles.
- [Flat HN](http://www.sagargv.com/proj/flathn) is a bookmarklet that hides nested comments on HackerNews.
- [All-Digital Color NTSC](http://www.sagargv.com/proj/ntsc) is a technique to generate double sideband modulated color NTSC televesion signals using only a microcontroller and a shift register.
