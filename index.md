I'm a postdoctoral researcher hosted by [Partha Talukdar](https://research.google/people/ParthaTalukdar/) at Google Research. My current research is on helping novice users learn how to navigate the Android UI by leveraging large language models. In a previous life, I worked on low-power circuits and imitation learning for robots. Here is my [CV](/static/pdf/sagar_cv2.pdf).

## Projects
- [Good Old Web](https://www.goodoldweb.com) is a collection of open-source, slim webapps that make very little use of javascript.
- [Kage](/kage/) is a 2D infinite running game where you play as a crow.
- [Cookoo](/proj/cookoo/) is a device that keeps track of pressure cooker whistles.
- [Flat HN](/proj/flathn/) is a bookmarklet that hides nested comments on HackerNews.
- [All-Digital Color NTSC](/proj/ntsc/) is a technique to generate double sideband modulated color NTSC televesion signals using only a microcontroller and a shift register.
